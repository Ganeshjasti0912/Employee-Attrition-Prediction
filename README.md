Employee attrition, or turnover, is a significant challenge faced by organizations across industries. It leads to increased costs related to hiring, training new employees, and maintaining employee morale, not to mention the potential disruption in productivity. Organizations must continuously strive to retain top talent and reduce employee turnover to remain competitive. 
The purpose of this project is to develop a predictive model that identifies employees at risk of leaving the organization. By analyzing various factors such as employee demographics, job roles, and performance metrics, the project aims to help organizations proactively address the causes of attrition and retain key employees.
